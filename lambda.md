# Lambda & Functions as a Service

There is no state (like its name!).  functions subscribe to an event, run when invoked and then shut down.  Serves are always on and always listening.

* Amazon's function as a service: `lambda`
* Other providers have a "functions as a service" (i.e., AWS, Azure, Google, Firebase, Kubeless, Spotinist, Cloudflare).

## Serverless

* https://serverless.com/
* "Serverless" is not always the framework people are using.
