# 1. CERN httpd (later also known as W3C httpd)
# 2. NCSA HTTPd: among the earliest web servers developed, following Tim Berners-Lee's CERN httpd, Tony Sanders' Plexus server, and some others. It was for some time the natural counterpart to the *Mosaic* web browser (popularized internet protocols such as FTP) in the clientâ€“server World Wide Web. 
# 3. Apache HTTP Server: Originally based on the NCSA HTTPd server
