* Arrival Time:       Time at which the process arrives in the ready queue.
* Completion Time:    Time at which process completes its execution.
* Burst Time:         Time required by a process for CPU execution.
* Turn Around Time:   Time Difference between completion time and arrival time.          
	- (Turn Around Time = Completion Time - Arrival Time)

* Waiting Time(W.T): Time Difference between turn around time and burst time.
	- (Waiting Time = Turn Around Time - Burst Time)
