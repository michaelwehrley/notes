# 1. CERN httpd (later also known as W3C httpd)
# 2. NCSA HTTPd: among the earliest web servers developed, following Tim Berners-Lee's CERN httpd, Tony Sanders' Plexus server, and some others. It was for some time the natural counterpart to the *Mosaic* web browser (popularized internet protocols such as FTP) in the clientâ€“server World Wide Web. 
# 3. Apache HTTP Server: Originally based on the NCSA HTTPd server

# MUTual EXclusion
# In computer science, a lock or mutex (from mutual exclusion) is a synchronization mechanism for enforcing limits on access to a resource in an environment where there are many threads of execution.
# A lock is designed to enforce a mutual exclusion concurrency control policy.
